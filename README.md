# Plume Intrusion Layer Simulator (PILS)
PILS is a MATLAB package that provides functionalities to simulate the height (or depth) where multiphase plumes trap when released in stratified water enviromment and subject to crossflow velocity.

Input parameters


Ambient stratification, crossflow velocity, the size and density of the dispersed phase(s) such as oil droplets, gas bubbles or sediments.

Processes the Simulator considers	


Buoyant lateral spreading, dispersion, advection
